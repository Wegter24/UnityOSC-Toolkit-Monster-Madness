# UnityOSC-Toolkit-Monster-Madness
A Gear-VR City Destruction Simulation using Motion Capture and Isadora.
Made for the HKU ECT as a Seminar Project called "Building Playful Interactions in a sensing space"

# Project Content #
This project was made with Unity.

◈ Isadora was used to control the surrounding lights, sounds and ambience.

◈ Motion traced gloves have been used to control the playable monsters fists in the game.

◈ A Motion traced headgear has been used to define the position in the space.

◈ A Gear-VR was used to create the VR experience for the player that controls the monster. The Gear-VR allows the monster to step in the world and see things the way the monster would see it.

◈ The Second display can be used to see an helicopter which has an overview of the city.

  ◊ The Helicopter can be further controlled by using a keyboard. Changing position with the arrow keys and perspective using the space       key.
  
# How to Use #
The project was made for a very specific enviroment that was configurated for this set-up. Trying to recreate this enviroment might have complications and porting it to I.E. HTC Vive or other VR/Motion capture enviroments might be complicated. For this I recommend checking out the original documentation we used to set it up. https://github.com/hku-ect/UnityOSCToolkit
